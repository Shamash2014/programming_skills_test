### 1. 
  
  Write a program that accepts a comma separated string of numbers depicting the daily stock price of AXY Company. The program should calculate the biggest daily fluctuation (in terms of percentage) of the stock price on any given day.

  For example, let us suppose the following is the input string:

  INPUT
  20,23,25,30,22,21,16

  Then the corresponding biggest fluctuation is:

  OUTPUT
  26.6666666666667 (As the maximum fluctuation in price is between 22 and 30)

### 2.

  Write a program that accepts 4 words as input (one per line) and identifies whether they are palindromes. A palindrome is a word that reads the same when read back to front. The program should print the alphabetically sorted list of palindromes (one per line). The program output should be in lowercase.
  
  If the following input is given to the program:

    waas
    gaag
    haaha
    ABBA

  Then the output of program should be:

    abba
